# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
#run the cron job using bash; in case #!/bin/bash missing in script
SHELL=/bin/bash
#0 * * * * /home/ubuntu/gitroot/BD2KGenomics/dcc-action/luigi_task_executor/run_Luigi_Deciders.sh

#test cron for to see if it is working
* * * * * echo "cron job executed as $USER!" >> /tmp/decider_log 2>&1
#test cron that will run cron job as $USER (not sure this works)
#* * * * * su ubuntu -c 'echo "su cron job executed as $USER!" >> /tmp/decider_log 2>&1'
#test cron for root
#* * * * * echo "cron job executed!" >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
# An empty line is required at the end of this file for a valid cron file.
